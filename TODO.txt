Add mimumum capacity to heap?
Make heap threadsafe (or make threadsafe wrapper for queue) so can parallelize
Add replace to heap/queue (replaces first with new element) (more efficient; only need to balance once)
Return value/exceptions when empty?
Make preserve FIFO order (either store timestamp or keep index of when added) (make separate version)
Implement IEnummerable and/or ICollection? Will simplify making threadsafe because can use BlockingCollection




Unit Testing:
- Attributes: ExpectedException, Timeout
